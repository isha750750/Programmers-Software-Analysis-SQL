Programmers-Software-Analysis-SQL
This SQL-based project manages and analyzes programmer, software, and study-related data. It includes complex queries for insights like highest-selling software, programmers’ salaries, course fee analysis, institute performance, and software profitability. Ideal for SQL learners focusing on joins, subqueries, and aggregation.

# Programmers Software Analysis SQL Project

This project demonstrates database design and advanced SQL queries for a fictional company managing programmers, their developed software, and academic studies.

Project Highlights:
- Database Design with Relationships (Foreign Keys)
- Data Insertion for Programmers, Software, and Studies
- Complex SQL Queries using:
  - **Joins**
  - **Subqueries**
  - **Aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)**
  - **CASE & Conditional Queries**
- Business Insights Reports like:
  - Programmers without knowledge of specific languages
  - Language-wise average development cost and sales price
  - Programmers’ contribution to software development
  - Highest/Lowest Selling Packages Analysis
  - Salary & Course Comparisons
  - Institute Performance Reports

Tables:
1. **Programmer**
2. **Software**
3. **Studies**

Key Features:
- Identify top-performing programmers & institutes
- Analyze sales performance of software packages
- Compare course fees across institutes
- Salary analysis by gender and experience
- Advanced filtering using nested subqueries

 SQL Features Used:
- Table Creation (DDL)
- Insert, Update, and Delete Operations (DML)
- ALTER TABLE for Schema Modifications
- Aggregate Functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- Subqueries (Nested Queries)
- String Matching with `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE`
- Group By & Having Clauses
- Data Sorting with `ORDER BY`

 Sample Advanced Queries:
- Highest selling software by language and price
- Institute-wise package sales summary
- Programmers developing software before/after specific dates
- Gender-based salary comparisons
- Packages developed below average copies sold

 Usage:
1. Run `CREATE TABLE` scripts to set up schema.
2. Insert data using provided SQL commands.
3. Apply `ALTER TABLE` & `UPDATE` statements for additional columns and updates.
4. Execute the provided analytical queries for results.
